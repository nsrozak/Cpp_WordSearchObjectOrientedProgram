The cat was happy playing with the toy
Then the cat ate dinner
Eating made the cat sleepy so the cat decided to take a nap

The dog ate dinner at the same time that the cat ate dinner
The dog wanted to go for a walk after dinner
The owner took the dog on a walk to the park
The dog played with its toy at the park
