A pet store has many animals
This pet store has a cat and a dog that are best friends
The cat and dog want to get adopted by the same owner
A girl met the dog one day and took it for a walk
The girl is allergic to cats and could not also get the cat
The pet store owner did not want to separate the friends so she did not sell the dog to the girl
